# A Simple WebGPU Pathtracer

Welcome to the repository of my WebGPU Pathtracer project! This project is a straightforward implementation of a pathtracer using WebGPU and TypeScript. It's designed to be a starting point for those interested in exploring the capabilities of WebGPU in rendering and graphics programming.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies.

### Installation

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the project in your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/oooFreaKooo/webgpu-pathtracer.git](https://github.com/oooFreaKooo/WebGPU_Simple_Pathtracer.git)
   ```

Here's the adjusted section with the additional information about `ngrok.exe`:

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
````

4. **Start the Project**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the pathtracer in your default web browser.

5. **Share Your Local Project**

   If you want to share your local project with others, you can use `ngrok.exe` to create a secure tunnel to your local server. Run `ngrok.exe` and use the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

   Replace `3000` with the port number your project is running on. This will provide a public URL that you can share with others.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify the code to learn more about WebGPU and path tracing. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to delve into advanced graphics programming with modern web technologies.
