Welcome to the repository of my WebGPU Pathtracer project! This project is a straightforward implementation of a pathtracer using WebGPU and TypeScript. It's designed to be a starting point for those interested in exploring the capabilities of WebGPU in rendering and graphics programming.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies.

### Installation

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the project in your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/oooFreaKooo/webgpu-pathtracer.git](https://github.com/oooFreaKooo/WebGPU_Simple_Pathtracer.git)
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Project**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the pathtracer in your default web browser.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and modify the code to learn more about WebGPU and path tracing. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to delve into advanced graphics programming with modern web technologies.

## License

This project is open-source and available to anyone. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code in your own projects, whether personal, educational, or commercial. No attribution is required, but always appreciated!
